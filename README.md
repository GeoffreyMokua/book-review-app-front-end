# Moviefy-Movies App.
In today's world, everyone watches movies or television. However, we still have some people who prefer to read their books. However, unlike movies and television, we don't really have platfroms for people to review books, and recommend books for others to read. In comes book review application. Here users are able to add a review for a book, as well as recommend it to other readers on whether they should purchase the book or not.

Backend repo: https://github.com/GeoffreyMokua/book-review-app

You can find the application at: https://github.com/GeoffreyMokua/book-review-app-front-end

# How it works
Users will need to log in into the application in order to access the list of books. If they do not have an account, they are encouraged to sign up for an account. Once they sign up, they will be redirected to the book reviews page, which will display a list of books for them to view and rate. Moreover, users are able to add books that they do not see on the book review page. If a user is done reading a book and they do not see it on the list of books, they can navigate to the add book page. Here, users can add their desired books.

Enjoy book review app and happy reading!
